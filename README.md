# Personal-Web-Project
**This is a work in progress**
A website that I am working on to have a solid grasp on some of the core web concepts outside of class and hopefully learn new things from.
Libraries used:
1-Express : To create HTTP routes
2-Multer + BodyParser: to parse user data and store it
3-Handlebars: Rendering engine to minimize code repetition and store all the reusable data inside the defualt layout
4-Mongoose: to access MongoDB database (also using Robo3T for GUI MongoDB inspection)
